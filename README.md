- 👋 Hi, I’m @janeckaj
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding the genetic and genomic factors that contribute to adaptation, population divergence,
speciation, and important phenotypes. I am fascinated by both the mechanisms and how we can apply these fields to improve
both conservation and wildlife management.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing research on conservaton genetics of snow leopards, genomics of numerous species including
snow leopards, bobcats, and camels, population genetics of snow leopards, white-tailed deer and black bear, evolution
of mammals, and wildlife forensics. I also teach genetics and bioinformatics at Duquesne University and provide training
in R, bioinformatics, and genetics through my YouTUbe channel.
- 💞️ I’m going to post data files and resources related to my work. I am looking to collaborate on projects
that incorporate genetics into wildlife reasearch and management.
